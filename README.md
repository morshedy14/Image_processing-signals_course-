# Image Processing Project: Histogram Analysis and Image Enhancement

This project involves a series of image processing tasks, focusing on histogram analysis and various image transformations, including brightness adjustment, contrast enhancement, and histogram equalization. The code snippets demonstrate techniques for manipulating and analyzing images using MATLAB, with a particular emphasis on grayscale images.

## Project Overview

The project has four main parts:

- **Task (a)**: Synthesizes a random image and displays its histogram alongside an original image's histogram.
- **Task (b)**: Demonstrates how to brighten and darken an image, and displays the transformed images along with their histograms and transformation functions.
- **Task (c)**: Histogram equalization on a grayscale image, displaying the original and equalized images with their respective histograms and transformation functions.

## File Structure

- `cameraman.tif`: The original image used for various transformations.
- `synthesized_image`: A randomly generated image for demonstration purposes.
- `brightened_image`: The result of brightening the original image.
- `darkened_image`: The result of darkening the original image.
- `eq_img`: The result of histogram equalization on the original grayscale image.

## How to Run the Project

To run this project, you need MATLAB installed on your system. Here's how to execute the code:

1. **Load the Original Image**:
   The project uses `cameraman.tif` as the original image. Ensure this file is in the same directory as your MATLAB script.

2. **Execute the Code**:
   Run the MATLAB script to see the various image transformations and histogram analyses.

3. **View the Results**:
   The script generates several figures showing the results of image transformations and their corresponding histograms and output transforms.
